;; - Compute the probability of the pattern (pattern_prob).
;; - Generate all partitions excluding the pattern.
;; - Calculate the probabilities of all partitions (iprob).
;; - Identify the minimum and maximum probabilities (emin, emax) of the partitions.
;; - Compute the distance of pattern_prob from the interval [emin,emax]
;; - Normalize the distance if required.
;; - Bound the final surprisingness value to a maximum of 1.0



;;The total count is implemented using the binomial coefficient and the power of 
;;the database size and number of conjuncts, because in the classic implementation, 
;;the documentation recommends using powers — but the actual implementation uses the binomial coefficient.

;;Calculates the total possible counts for a pattern based on database size 
;;and the number of conjunctive clauses in the pattern.

;; Function: isurp-old
;; Description: Computes the I-surprisingness of a conjunctive pattern based on its probability 
;;              and the distribution of probabilities from independently generated partitions. 
;;              It measures how far the pattern's probability deviates from the expected interval 
;;              defined by the minimum and maximum probabilities. Optionally, the surprisingness 
;;              value can be normalized.
; Parameters:
;   - $pattern: A conjunctive pattern whose surprisingness is to be evaluated.
;   - $db: The database or corpus used for evaluating probabilities.
;   - $normalize: A boolean flag indicating whether to normalize the surprisingness by the pattern's probability.
; Returns:
;   - A numeric value representing the surprisingness score, optionally normalized and capped at 1.0.
